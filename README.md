While round-up savings sound exciting, we've enhanced the game! Instead of rounding up, we're now squirreling away 1% of every transaction amount directly into your vault. So, every time you make a purchase, your savings get a boost, and you don't have to worry about inflated prices often associated with round-up pricing on e-commerce platforms. It's a simple tweak that maximizes your savings without compromising on the thrill of rounding up! üí∞‚ú®
